### Problem 1
```
Write a program that takes a list of strings containing integers and
words and returns a sorted version of the list. The output should maintain the
positions of strings and numbers as they appeared in the original string.

Input : car truck 8 4 bus 6 1
Output: bus car 1 4 truck 6 8

### Problem 2
[See Benchmarks](https://github.com/Hackermen/python-experiments/blob/master/benchmark-1.py) of different implementations by me and others guys.
```
You are given an array which will have a length of at least 3,
but could be very large. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers
or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N.
Write a function that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Return: 11
