### Problem 1
```
Write a program that takes a list of strings containing integers and
words and returns a sorted version of the list. The output should maintain the
positions of strings and numbers as they appeared in the original string.

Input : car truck 8 4 bus 6 1
Output: bus car 1 4 truck 6 8

### Problem 2
```
You are given an array which will have a length of at least 3,
but could be very large. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers
or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N.
Write a function that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

Input  : [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Output : 11

### Problem 3
```
Write a function that takes a message and reverses the order
of the words *in-place*.

Input : others on depend not do salvation own your out work
Output: work out your own salvation do not depend on others
