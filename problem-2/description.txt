You are given an array which will have a length of at least 3,
but could be very large. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers
or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N.
Write a function that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

For example:

[10, 5, 20]
Return: 5

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Return: 11

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Return: 160
